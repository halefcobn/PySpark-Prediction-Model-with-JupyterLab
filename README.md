# PySpark-with-JupyterLab
  A data analysis example hase been performed using PySpark.
  As a python file, there are two files, one is about the intro about PySpark and the other is for the regression model for prediction values.

# The Aim and The Methods:
  This is my first project using with PySapark which is widely used in big data and its problems.
  The aim of this project is to discover the details of PySpark with a project that will contribute a lot to learn important skills.
  
# The problems:  
There have been problems in code. Some of them are fixed, but other is not resolved.
It is known where the problem is, but it is not solved yet. 
The first problem has been revealed in the drop function when using "any=" and "subset=".

The problem statement: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "builtin_function_or_method") to str

TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
/Users/halef/Desktop/Coursera/PySpark/PySpark-1.ipynb Cell 45 in <cell line: 1>()
----> 1 df_pyspark.na.drop(how=any, subset=["PM"]).show(4)

# As a Result:
The problem did not make a bigger issues, Thus the project is concluded successfully.
The prediction model is more accurete by calculation the mean squared errors and mean absolute error.

Thank you.
